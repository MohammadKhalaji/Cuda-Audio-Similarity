# Cuda-Audio-Similarity
Multicore Programming course final project. 

Checks audio similarity using fourier transform, implemented with CUDA and cuFFT. 

Takes two arguments: 
1. Path to whole music files
2. Path to short sample files

Then the pairwise comparison begins. 

All input data MUST be in `.txt` format, which could be obtained from converting audio files to `.wav` extension, and converting the `.wav` file to `.txt`.
